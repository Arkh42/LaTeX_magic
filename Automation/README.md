# Automating LaTeX

As explained at the root level of this repository, LaTeX is often perceived as difficult to use.
This assertion can be mitigated if two conditions are fulfilled.
On the one hand, clear and concise tutorials must be provided.
On the other hand, user-friendly interfaces must be built so that only the compilation and some usual LaTeX commands remain as the "exotic" use of LaTeX.
The latter is the goal of this section.

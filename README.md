# LaTeX_magic

LaTeX is often seen as:
* a very complicated programming language, 
* not user-friendly at all, 
* impossible to learn in a short time, 
* and so on.

The aim of this repository consists in providing some *magic tricks* to help users to master LaTeX quikly.


## Repository development

The repository shall be organised as follow:
* Automation
	* Classes
	* Packages
* Tutorials

The *Automation* folder aims the automation of LaTeX in order to improve the usability for newbies.
(I mean, for beginners. I am still very kind. Some people call them Dummies...)

The *Tutorials* folder gathers the minimum information required to understand specific subjects
(e.g., mathematics with LaTeX) and proposes additional information (URLs, books references...)
for those who want to go further.

Information related to a specific folder is provided through a "README.md" file located at the folder level.

# Mathematics - Basics

This first tutorial on mathematics aims the basics of writing mathematics with LaTeX.
It includes:
* difference between text-mode and math-mode,
* the *equation* environment,
* inline equations and *displaystyle*,
* groups of equations (*gather* and *align* environments).

Other usual questions related to mathematics are adressed in the C1xx tutorials.
